All detection results in the paper are obtained from simulation. Due to a data migration disaster the original code was lost. Due to this and other reasons you won't be able to get the results from the paper. The provided code is an attempt to get the results. You can get FPR ranging from 1.2% to 2.2% and detection rate ranging from 95% to 100% with this code. Close enough for me. You can probably get slightly better result if you want to spend months on it. You can tweak all those the training parameters, ccTLDs and threshold search parameters, some combinations/runs will give better result than others. Good luck.
